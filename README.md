# 2010 YouTube Player
2010 YouTube Player, taken from BitView and Mr Half-Life'd

# Run the server locally
You need a live server extension in VSCode [(for example what I'm using)](https://open-vsx.org/vscode/item?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) but I haven't actually tested deploying it on web hosting providers

# Credits
Of course, I wanna credit the people over Bittoco to actually make the player, I just wanted to make my own version of the player and let the public actually use it for their revivals
